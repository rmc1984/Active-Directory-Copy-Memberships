# Active Directory Copy Memberships
This is a C# program that uses WPF as the interface. In the background it will run powershell to update the selected Active Directory user accounts. In the first text box you type in the user name of the account that you want to copy from. In the second text box you can type in one or more user accounts to be copied to. Just type a comma and a space between multiple users like this. bob.jones, ron.clark, jessica.miller. Then simple click the copy button and it will run.
